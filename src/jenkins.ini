# [jenkins] section
# To search jobs from Jenkins
#
#   [jenkins/alice]
#       Which Jenkins instance?
#       * Default value: None
#       jenkins_base_url = http://some_url:port/
#
#       From which folders you want to start searching from?
#       * input type: comma separated list of folders (case sensitive).
#       * To start searching from main Jenkins dashboard, just use '/'.
#       * This feature is introduced, so that you don't always have to navigate from main dashboard.
#       * Default value: / (So, by default it can search and navigate from main dashboard)
#       search_starts_from = /, FolderOne/SubFolderOne
#
#       Username to use (Required if authorization is needed)
#       * Default value: None
#       username = alice
#
#       Jenkins api token for the above user (Required if authorization is needed)
#       * Create api token from 'https://{jenkins_domain}/user/{username}/configure'. It's recommended to use new api token just for this plugin.
#       * Default value: None
#       api_token = 234w93i2d9e293k40dlkk39ks
#
#       What to type in launcher to search these jobs?
#       * Default value: Jenkins-{{section name}} (in this case it's, Jenkins-alice)
#       searchable_as = JenkinsProd
#
#       Store fetched jobs in cache?
#       * This does one time fetch and stores them in memory. So less network calls.
#       * Note: Jobs created after the fetch will not show up for searching. In such cases, restart
# the plugin to get the latest update. Or set the value to False.
#       * Default value: True
#       enable_cache = True
#
#   * Example:
#           [jenkins/bob]
#           jenkins_base_url = http://frcv01:9999/
#           # Note for below config: you can only search & navigate jobs from 'Administration' folder
#           search_starts_from = Administration
#           username = admin
#           api_token = 234w93i2d9e293k40dlkk39ks
#           searchable_as = prod


# [agent] section
# To search agent nodes and labels
#
#   [agent/linux_1]
#       Which Jenkins instance?
#       * Default value: None
#       jenkins_base_url = http://some_url:port/
#
#       Username to use (Required if authorization is needed)
#       * Default value: None
#       username = alice
#
#       Jenkins api token for the above user (Required if authorization is needed)
#       * Create api token from 'https://{jenkins_domain}/user/{username}/configure'. It's recommended to use new api token just for this plugin.
#       * Default value: None
#       api_token = 234w93i2d9e293k40dlkk39ks
#
#       What to type in launcher to search these nodes?
#       * Default value: Jenkins-{{section name}} (in this case it's, Jenkins-alice)
#       searchable_as = JenkinsProd
#
#   * Example:
#           [agent/win_64_2019]
#           jenkins_base_url = http://frcv01:9999/
#           search_starts_from = Administration
#           username = admin

[var]
# As in every Keypirinha's configuration file, you may optionally include a
# [var] section to declare variables that you want to reuse anywhere else in
# this file.
#
# Note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value defined
# in the main configuration file of the application (i.e.: "Keypirinha.ini") has
# already been made available to this file as well so you do not need to
# duplicate it here unless you want to override it.
#
# REMINDER: For convenience, Keypirinha silently populates this section with
# predefined values that may come handy. Here are some of them: APP_DIR,
# APP_EXE, PROFILE_DIR, PROFILE_DIR_INSTALLED_PACKS, PROFILE_DIR_LIVE_PACKS,
# PROFILE_DIR_USER and the KNOWNFOLDER_* and KNOWNFOLDERGUID_* values.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.


[env]
# For convenience, Keypirinha populates this [env] section in every loaded
# configuration file so you can easily access to environment variables like
# PATH for example from this file using syntax: ${env:PATH}
#
# If an environment variable happens to be changed while Keypirinha is running
# and this modification impacts current configuration, application and packages
# configuration will be reloaded if needed only.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.
